# Store Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## Description

This project analyzes historical store sales data and forecasts future sales trends using time-series modeling techniques. It leverages ARIMA for forecasting and applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the data.

**Problem Solved:**  
Retailers often struggle to anticipate future sales due to fluctuating demand and external factors. This project provides a data-driven approach to predict sales, enabling better inventory management and business planning.
